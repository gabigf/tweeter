# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

A user is able to write a new tweet and have it displayed along with the other existing tweets. In order to view the input to write a tweet, click on the "Write a new tweet" button on the top right of the screen. There will be an error that will pop up if you don't enter anything or you enter too many characters.
This page is fully responsive.
